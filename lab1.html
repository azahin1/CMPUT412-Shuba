    <h3>Connecting and Operating</h3>
    <p>
        This exercise was an introduction to use the duckietown, duckiebot, and docker.
        Firstly I tried to connect to the bot with my laptop and tried to make it move, and see what its camera sees. 
        But that's just connecting to the bot. To do automation and other programming, I needed to calibrate the cameras and the wheels.

        Oh wow look at that, the dashboard of the bot to see what the bot sees and how its wheels work.

    <p>
        Oh wow look at that, a video showing how streight it goes... but that took so long. The bot seems to change how it works from time to time.
        That's why I had to recalibrate over and over again to finally get a streight line.

    <p>
        To connect to the bot, I also need to know a bit of networking.
        Getting my laptop and the bot's MAC address was a part of it along with connecting to the system of the bot vis SSH.

        After that, a basic knowledge of Docker was needed to make the line following work. But as the setup was compleate, I could run the line following very effectively.

    <h3>Basic Development</h3>
    <p>
        For development, of course Git and Github is required. To develop docker images and uploading them to dockerhub with python, a place to start is needed.
        Thankfully duckiebots are open source and available in Github. Forking that repository and using it as a base to run code from the bot was a perfect start.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, problems arose imediately when running Hello World through the bot. As seen below in the images, I could develop the package, create an image locally, and run it.

        But as soon as I tried to create the image from the bot using Docker, errors constantly popped up.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get to the root of the problem, I SSHed into the duckiebot and tried to log in to Docker. It failed. So I pinged Google to see if it was connected to the network. It was.
        So the problem was Docker. So I uninstalled and re-installed Docker, and it worked back up again.

        At the end, the image was made, and able to work properly.

    </p>
    <p>
        Then I tried to do some colour detection with the camera, but the credentials in the examples seemed to be off and it didn't work with anything.
        At this point, I ran out of time for the exercise so this part I couldn't finish.
